An ant moves on an infinite grid of squares that are coloured either black or white.
- if on a black square it rotates 90 degrees anticlockwise
- if it is on a white square it rotates 90 degrees clockwise
It then flips the colour of the square and moves forward one square. The grid starts all white. Watch the ant wander around and see the patterns created!
